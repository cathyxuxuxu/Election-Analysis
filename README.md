## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used for any election by either changing the candidate list to a list of preference or changing the county list to state list. For example, 1). If we want to use this script to analyze presidential election, we can simply modify the county list to a list of states. 2). If we want to use this script to analyze general election/local election/or even survey, we can modify the candidate list to a list of preference or choices.
